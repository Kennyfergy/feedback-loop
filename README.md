# Feedback Loop

## Description

Feedback Loop is a web-based application designed to gather and present feedback. Built using Javascript, React, CSS, HTML, and Redux, it offers a blend of server-side logic and client-side interactions. The main purpose of this project was to streamline the feedback process by collecting user responses and presenting them in a user-friendly manner.
